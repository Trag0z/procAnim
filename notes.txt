TODO:
- tune player acceleration/deceleration
- wall jump
- better default jump?


TODO LATER:
- remove Player::State::HITSTUN because it is not used anymore

- handle jump inputs in step mode better
- fix leg animations
- change the direction of the player texture another way than changing it's scale



Bugs:               (@BUG)
- one frame leg glitch into ground when starting to move
- SplineEditor sets connected tangents in wrong direction since it still assumes what has been true some time ago
- sometimes turns around due to stick snap-back?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)
- In some places, Game::simulate_world() uses CollisionData::t to determine a new position/move. Maybe it should use CollisionData::position instead, because that's more precise than t?
- replace std::abs with glm::abs

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
- move IK calculations to shader?
