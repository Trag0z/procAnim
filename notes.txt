TODO:
- find target points in a good way
- bone rotation restrictions

- longer bone chains, multiple parents?
- more polygons, nicer texture

Bugs:
- IK bones sometimes rotate >180 degrees quickly if the taret point passes the center point closely

Cleanup:
- remove using namespace ...; everywhere

Optimizations:
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time


Walking states:
(Leg1 straight in front, leg2 straight behind)
1) push body over leg1, bend leg2
2) leg1 moves to back, leg2 straightens, touches ground in front

- start in the middle of 1)
