NEXT:
- make pelvis move player pos directly
- only move upper body after steps?
- when turning around, the search for new animation positions is weird due to scale change in player

TODO:
- make T1/T2 be relative coordinates again?

- apply bone restrictions

- more polygons, nicer texture
- test utf8 chars in save/load strings

Bugs:               (@BUG)
- leans in while mid-step
- sometimes turns around due to stick snap-back?

- IK bones sometimes rotate >180 degrees quickly if the taret point passes the center point closely
- why does merging SplineEditor::update() and SplineEditor::update_gui() break the gui functionality?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)
- unify naming scheme for getter methods

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
- move IK calculations to shader

Paper:
- gendering?
- problem/hypothesis/method/limitations aufz√§hlung in einleitung?
