NEXT:
- when turning around, the search for new animation positions is weird due to scale change in player

TODO:
- wireframes don't get modified by bones

- apply bone restrictions

- more polygons, nicer texture
- test utf8 chars in save/load strings

Bugs:               (@BUG)
- SplineEditor sets other values even if connect tangents etc. is false
- sometimes turns around due to stick snap-back?

- IK bones sometimes rotate >180 degrees quickly if the taret point passes the center point closely
- why does merging SplineEditor::update() and SplineEditor::update_gui() break the gui functionality?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)
- unify naming scheme for getter methods

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
- move IK calculations to shader
