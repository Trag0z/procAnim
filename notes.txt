NEXT:
- saved spline is different in both bone spaces

TODO:
- use splines for limb movements
- find target points in a good way

- longer bone chains, multiple parents?
- more polygons, nicer texture

Bugs:               (@BUG)
- IK bones sometimes rotate >180 degrees quickly if the taret point passes the center point closely
- why does merging SplineEditor::update() and SplineEditor::update_gui() break the gui functionality?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
