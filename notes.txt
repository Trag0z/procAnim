TODO:
- bone rotation restrictions:
    > need to apply when out of range
    > are not used for bone[0]
    > not yet set for ArmAnimators
- use splines for limb movements
- find target points in a good way

- longer bone chains, multiple parents?
- more polygons, nicer texture

Bugs:
- IK bones sometimes rotate >180 degrees quickly if the taret point passes the center point closely

Cleanup:
- remove using namespace ...; everywhere

Optimizations:
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
