NEXT:
- display active spline on leading foot
- fix glitch into ground bug
- "crouch" when there is a lower ground to step on
    > find point around the target foot position with a variable for maximum delta to higher/lower edge


TODO:
- revert laptop compat changes
- apply bone restrictions

- longer bone chains, multiple parents?
- more polygons, nicer texture
- test utf8 chars in save/load strings

Bugs:               (@BUG)
- leans in while mid-step
- sometimes turns around due to stick snap-back?

- render_all_splines only renders walk splines

- IK bones sometimes rotate >180 degrees quickly if the taret point passes the center point closely
- why does merging SplineEditor::update() and SplineEditor::update_gui() break the gui functionality?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)
- unify naming scheme for getter methods

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
- set some vertex arrays as static if they don't change
- move IK calculations to shader
