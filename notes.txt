NEXT:
- debug collision detection
- change the direction of the player texture another way than changing it's scale

TODO:
- change fix camera
- hitboxes/attacks

- fix leg animations


Bugs:               (@BUG)
- one frame leg glitch into ground when starting to move
- SplineEditor sets connected tangents in wrong direction since it still assumes what has been true some time ago
- sometimes turns around due to stick snap-back?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
- move IK calculations to shader?
