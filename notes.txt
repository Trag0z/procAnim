TODO:
- zoom out, tune physics so player can jump and hit the ball in the air easily

- FIX: ball can clip into ground when hitting it from the top
- player weapon length changes when rotating stick



TODO LATER:
- remove first #define from pch.h and replace the deprecated functions
- handle jump inputs in step mode better
- fix leg animations
- change the direction of the player texture another way than changing it's scale



Bugs:               (@BUG)
- one frame leg glitch into ground when starting to move
- SplineEditor sets connected tangents in wrong direction since it still assumes what has been true some time ago
- sometimes turns around due to stick snap-back?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
- move IK calculations to shader?
