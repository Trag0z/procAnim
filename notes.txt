NEXT:
- react to collisions in hitstun

- bug: if player 1 stands inside player 2 and attacks, they both get hit

TODO:
- hitboxes/attacks

- handle jump inputs in step mode better

- fix leg animations
- change the direction of the player texture another way than changing it's scale



Bugs:               (@BUG)
- level editor selection does't work if camera is not on starting zoom
- when zoomed out and moving the camera, the player's leg origin position moves 
- one frame leg glitch into ground when starting to move
- SplineEditor sets connected tangents in wrong direction since it still assumes what has been true some time ago
- sometimes turns around due to stick snap-back?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
- move IK calculations to shader?
