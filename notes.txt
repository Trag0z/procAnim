TODO:
- find out why the arm position is never really at the target point
- find target points in a good way
- bone rotation restrictions

- collision detection
- longer bone chains, multiple parents?
- more polygons, nicer texture

Bugs:
- IK bones sometimes rotate >180 degrees quickly if the taret point passes the center point closely
