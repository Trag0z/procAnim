TODO LATER:
- player can be hit by ball
    > check everything that deals with Player::HITSTUN

- some version of goals
    > level editor
        + save/load new level format
        + rendering
    > count points
    > reset ball on score

- tune player acceleration/deceleration
- handle jump inputs in step mode better
- fix leg animations




Bugs:               (@BUG)
- one frame leg glitch into ground when starting to move
- SplineEditor sets connected tangents in wrong direction since it still assumes what has been true some time ago
- sometimes turns around due to stick snap-back?

Cleanup:            (@CLEANUP)
- In some places, Game::simulate_world() uses CollisionData::t to determine a new position/move. Maybe it should use CollisionData::position instead, because that's more precise than t?
- replace std::abs with glm::abs
- remove all unnecessary cases of indexed rendering and replace with non indexed version

Optimizations:      (@OPTIMIZE)
- bone.get_transform() is called often, calculates recursively every time
- move IK calculations to shader?
